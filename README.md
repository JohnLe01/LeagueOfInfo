A simple iOS app that displays statistics and image for each champion

## Getting started
### API Key
Before anything, make sure to replace 
```Swift
 private static let apiKey = "YOUR API KEY HERE"
```
in RiotAPI.swift with your own API Key in order to authorize the needed API calls for the app to run <br />
<br />
You can generate your own API Key at
